          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <br>
          <h4>How Poverty Effects...</h4>
          <p><strong>Healthcare:</strong> As poverty and healthcare have a strong positive relationship. Poverty increases the likelihood of not haveing insurance 
            coverage. This corresponds to a number of studies that have been done on this correlation. The reason for this disparity 
            varies from health insurance being connected to jobs, what types of job offer insurance and what kind. One major solution 
            to this problem would be for the government to provide health insurance instead so individuals aren't limited to the jobs they
            want to look for as well as plenty of other benefits.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Smoking:</strong> Poverty and smoking seem to have a negative relationship.</p>

          <p><strong>Obesity:</strong> As poverty increases so does obesity. This can be due to food deserts depending on location. Leaving people with a limited
            access to healthy food options.
          </p>

          <h4>How Age Effects...</h4>
          <p><strong>Healthcare:</strong> When healthcare access is a concern, the average age that has the greatest range is mid 30s to early 40s. There 
            doesn't seem to be a strong correlation between these two factors.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Smoking:</strong> These two factors are also clustered in the mid 30s and early 40s range with Utah population in their 30s being the 
            least likely to smoke and the oldest average age being 44 year-olds in Maine.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Obesity:</strong> These two factors are also clustered in the middle age region. This correlates to a growing number os studies that 
            show the U.S. population is getting larger compared to decades past.
          </p>

          <h4>How Income Effects...</h4>
          <p><strong>Healthcare:</strong> This correlation shows a positive relationship. This finding coinsides with multiple studies which state that wealth dictates 
            health. It is a concerning phenomenon especially here in the States when looking deeper into how this trend was formed. Although diseases and health conditions 
            don't discriminate, income plays a major role in how one is able to get help to overcome or manage their condition.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Smoking:</strong> There is a positive trend between these two factors in which people who smoke tend to have a lower income. A number of factors can lead 
            to this result be more research will need to be done. One would think that people with lower income would have more stress but there's also stress in higher income
            brackets as well--and both of them could be job related!
          </p>

          <p><strong>Obesity:</strong> These two factors are have less of a positive correlation. Obesity can be seen as a factor that connects with the healthcare component on 
            this graph. People in a higher income bracket may also have access to healthier food options and locations associated with wellness.
